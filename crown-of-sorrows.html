                            <h1>Encounter 01 - Dispel the Hive Ward</h1>
                            <p>Remember that room where The Mockery takes place? We're there. Please consult the map I stole from the internet below where the starting blessing is also where you place the rally banner.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/cos-encounter1.jpg" alt="good map I stole but too much text" /></span>
                            <h3>Classes</h3>
                            <ul class="alt">
                                <li><b>Hunters:</b> Tether or Golden Gun. Control the field if enemies get out of pocket or burst down ogres when time is of the essense.</li>
                                <li><b>Titans:</b> Any for add clear, I do not know your lives. Maybe a bubble over the witch's vessel for safety?</li>
                                <li><b>Warlocks:</b> Chaos Reach or Nova Bomb for ogre dps, just no roaming.</li>
				            </ul>
                            <h3>Weapons</h3>
                            <ul class="alt">
                                <li><b>Primary:</b> Consider a decent shotgun for knights so you can save your ammo for ogres or dire straits. If you're low on range in the other two slots, bring a sniper.</li>
                                <li><b>Special:</b> Everyone's gonna use Gnawing Hunter or Recluse here and I get it, it's fine. Now if you had a gun to turn a man into an orb, and then weild them, as an orb, to prevent enemies in your field from doing anything... I wouldn't stop you.</li>
                                <li><b>Heavy:</b> Swords are great, but just make sure you can cover some range across your other two slots. Xenophage, too, if you can maintain a good ammo supply. I feel grenade launchers invite a bit too much chaos.</li>
				            </ul>
                            <p>I don't want to explain anymore, making Datto do it, but the goal here is in 60 seconds we would have: gained buff, killed adds, kill knights, destroy crystal, switch buff. Rinse. Repeat. 7ish times. Easy. The things that will kill us are crystals and not having a good rhythm with buff switching.</p>

                            <h1>Intermission - Jump puzzle crystal thing</h1>
                            <p>We'll cross this bridge when we burn it. Kill crystals like Encounter 01, but now sometimes they have shields and you have to get close and punch them. Also, small platforms.</p>

						
                            <h1>Encounter 02 + 03 - Gahlran, the Sad Boy</h1>
                            <p>Kill adds, bubble and well are perhaps more important for survivability. Bring a sword for DPS, maybe, if you're too close we risk losing buffs which we need for DPS phases so... only some people bring swords. The rest of you I don't care. Also definitely phoning this in. Here, have two maps for the two phases plus a Datto video.</p>
